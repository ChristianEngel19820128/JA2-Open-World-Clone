# JA2-Open-World-Clone
JA2 Open World Clone written in BlitzMax

It's a Long-Term-Project in progress. Don't be affraid, it's denglish. And I have to much time, as long I don't have to cut the lawn.

1. The gfx Folder is added with example properties. Compile should work, even sfx is not included.

2. Support for custom config properties are still work in progress. So you have the possibility to add your own Mercs, Animations, Tiles, Houses, Items or what ever in different ways via config. If you can do so.

Planned Updates weekly to monthly. Uploads of compiled Version anytime.

BlitzMax offers you to compile at Windows, Unix/Linux or MacOS. If you have the compiler naturally.

The startfile is jagged.bmx.
