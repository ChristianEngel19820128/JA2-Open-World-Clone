# JA2-Open-World-Clone
JA2 Open World Clone written in BlitzMax

It's a Long-Term-Project in progress. Don't be affraid, it's denglish. And I have to much time, as long I don't have to cut the lawn.

1. There's no gfx and sfx Folder at the moment. So you can't compile the Project yet. Without Grafix and Sounds it's absolute useless. It's coming soon, if it's minimized to significant example properties and tidy up too.

2. Support for full custom properties are work in progress. So you have the possibility to add your own Mercs, Animations, Tiles, Houses, Items or what ever. If you can do so.

Planned Updates weekly to monthly. Uploads of compiled Version anytime.

BlitzMax offers you to compile at Windows, Unix/Linux or MacOS. If you have the compiler naturally.
